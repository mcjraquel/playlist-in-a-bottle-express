# playlist-in-a-bottle-express
Share and receive playlists from strangers

## What This Project Is About
I did this project as practice of building an Express/Node.js app with a MongoDB connection. This app's purpose is to let users send and receive digital "bottles" with playlists in them.

## How To Run This Project
1. Clone the repository
2. `cd playlist-in-a-bottle-express`
3. `npm install`

You would need to create a `.env` file with the following values:
- `SPOTIFY_API_ID` & `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET`: Can be generated by creating a Spotify app on Spotify. More info [here](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/tutorials/getting-started)https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/tutorials/getting-started
- `CALLBACK_URL`: Where the Spotify sign-in page will redirect the user (e.g., `http://localhost:8888/callback`)
- `SITE_URL`: Where the app is hosted (e.g., `http://localhost:8888`)
- `MONGODB_URI`: URI of the MongoDB connection
